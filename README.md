## Architecture

The architecture of this application is built around a modern stack to ensure scalability, security, and performance:

- **Front-End**: Built with **Next.js**, a React framework that provides server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.
- **Back-End**: Managed by **Supabase**, which provides authentication, database, and storage solutions.
- **Database**: Utilizes **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage.
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** is used for utility-first styling.

The application follows a modular architecture for clear separation of concerns and easier maintenance.

## Approach

1. **Planning**: Defined the core features and the requirements for the blog application.
2. **Development**:
   - **Front-End**: Implemented using Next.js with server-side rendering. Integrated Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
   - **Back-End**: Configured Supabase to handle user authentication, database operations, and file storage.
3. **Testing**: Conducted manual testing to verify functionality and usability. Ensured all features work as expected before deployment.
5. **Deployment**: Deployed the application on Vercel and provided instructions for running it locally.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/taldr27/blog_test
   cd blog_test
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
  
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
   Alternatively, you can use npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
## Configuration

1. **Create a Supabase Project:**

   - Go to Supabase and create a new project.
   - Note your Supabase URL and Anon Key from the project settings.
2. **Create env.local in the root of the project and add:**

   ```.env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000/auth/callback"
   ```
   You can get these values from Supabase dashboard `Project Settings -> API`
3. **Create tables, policies, functions and triggers:**
   
   - Go to supabase/schema.sql.
   - Copy all and paste it in a query in your SQL Editor in your supabase dashboard.
   - Run the query and you will have everything created automatically.ðŸ«¡

     Just in case: The schema.sql dump file was generated by using:

     ```bash
     npx supabase init
     npx supabase link (select your database)
     npx supabase db dump -f supabase/schema.sql Important: you need to have docker running for this command.
     ```

4. **To be able to post images in your posts or comments you need to:**

   - Go to you Supabase dasboard and create a new bucket `Storage -> New bucket`.
   - Name the new bucket as `blog_images`, if you prefer you can create a new env variable for this.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   This will start the server at http://localhost:3000.
2. Access the application locally.

   Navigate to http://localhost:3000.
